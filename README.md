# Daijin ダイジン
## Daijin is project that's good on the outside and bad on the inside.

This Python project provides a simple file encryption and decryption tool using the cryptography library. It allows you to encrypt files using a generated key and decrypt them back to their original state. The project consists of two scripts: one for encryption and one for decryption.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/Eve-SatOrU/Daijin.git
```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
```
cd Daijin
```
3. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install cryptography
```
# Usage
## Encryption
1. Place the files you want to encrypt in the repository directory.

2. Run the encryption script:
```
python3 withlove.py
```

3. The script will generate a key (thekey.key) and encrypt the files' contents using this key.

## Decryption
1. Run the decryption script:
```
python3 love.py
```
3. Keep the thekey.key file safe. It's required for both encryption and decryption.
